# CPEN 212: Hacking

Let's look at some code!

``` C
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    volatile long ans = 42;
    char buf[16];
    gets(buf);
    printf("the answer is: %d\n", ans);
    return 0;
}
```

`gets()` reads a line from stdin into the buffer pointed to  by s until either a newline or EOF.

The problem? `gets()` won't stop at 16 chars. It could just keep reading!x
