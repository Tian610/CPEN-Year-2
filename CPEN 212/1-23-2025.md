# CPEN 212: Linking Continued

## Static Linking:
```
ELF header                  // Architecture, word size, endianness
program header              // Section types, locations, addrs, RWX,...
.text section               // Program Code
.rodata section             // Initialized Read Only Data
.data section               // Initialized writable data
.bss section                // Uninitialized data
.symtab section             // Defined / Referenced Symbols
various rel, plt, got       // Relocation Tables: How to modify
sections                    // Instr/data to set symbol addresses
.debug section              // Debugging Info
section header              // Section types/ locations for linking
```


## Symbol Resolution
- Find references to **unresolved symbols** (e.g. printf())
- FInd matching entries in **symbol table**
- Replace each reference with a **unique definition**

Every referenced symbol must be defined somewhere. An example of not doing this:
``` 
cc main.o
/usr/bin/ld: main.o: in function `main’:
    .../main.c:6: undefined reference to `cons'
/usr/bin/ld: .../main.c:10: undefined reference to `print_list’
```

Any symbol can only be defined **once** (unless "weak"). Another example:

```
cc main.o crazylist.o crazylist.o
/usr/bin/ld: crazylist.o: in function `cons’:
.../crazylist.c:18: multiple definition of `cons’;
crazylist.o:.../crazylist.c:18: first defined here
...
```

### Symbol Resolution Procedure

Load symbol tables from all obects being linked.

For each referenced but undefined symbol:
- Find it in the symtabs
- If defined, replace with definition's address
- If defined multiple times, error out
- If never defined, error out

After this, we move onto:

## Symbol Relocation

- Merge code and data sections from .o files into one
- Move each symbol to an address that does not conflict
- Replace each reference to a symbol with an address

``` ARM
$ objdump –dzr crazylist.o
···
0000000000000010 <cons>:
···
    24: d2800200 mov x0, #0x10
    28: 94000000 bl 0 <malloc>              // Bogus Target Address
                28: R_AARCH64_CALL26 malloc
                // Breakdown:
                // 0x28: First byte to edit
                // R_AARCH64_CALL26: How to replace the instr
                // malloc: Replacement sym
    2c: f9000414 str x20, [x0, #8]
···
0000000000000150 <print_list>:
...
160: 90000014 adrp x20, 0 <enclosing_struct>
                160: R_AARCH64_ADR_PREL_PG_HI21 .rodata.str1.8
164: aa0003f3 mov x19, x0
168: 91000294 add x20, x20, #0x0
                168: R_AARCH64_ADD_ABS_LO12_NC .rodata.str1.8
...
```


## A brief aside on `#include`

A header or another file contains lots of useful information, like declarations of variable and functions. However, using `#include<main.h>` is **not** linking. It's merely passing information to the compiler to tell it to, well, include the definitions for the actual implementations. It's basically just copy pasting code from one file into another. No compilation is happening.

## Dynamic Linking

A quick refresh:
- Resolution and relocation completed at **program load time**
- Some libraries (plugins) can be loaded at **runtime**

Let's take a look at an example:

``` ARM
···
00000000000008f0 <cons>:
···
// We have some suspiciously low addrs. Would be on page 0... Segfault?
904: d2800200 mov x0, #0x10
908: 97ffff62 bl 690 <malloc@plt>   // What is plt?
                 // 690 is an interesting address
90c: f9000414 str x20, [x0, #8]
···

// Let's take a look at 690
0000000000000690 <malloc@plt>:
690: f00000f0 adrp x16, 1f000 <__FRAME_END__+0x1e35c>
694: f947d611 ldr x17, [x16, #0xfa8]
698: 913ea210 add x16, x16, #0xfa8
69c: d61f0220 br x17
    // Branch into x17 (0x1ff80)?

// Branches into here
Contents of section .got:
1ff80 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 ................
1ff90 00000000 00000000 50060000 00000000 ........P.......
1ffa0 50060000 00000000 50060000 00000000 P.......P.......
```

Let's take a look at something else first:

### Challenges in Dynamic Linking
We don't want to copy library code
- That is kinda the point of dynamic linking

And we don't want to edit the code in memory
- It'd take forever

So we map the existing library **somewhere** in our virtual address range... And put the **actual addresses** in the library's **symtab**.

Now, to avoid editing program code:

- We pick a unique offset for each symbol (function, etc.):
  - `malloc = 1, free = 2`
- Create an **offset table** to map indices to addresses
- Make all fn calls indirect viat the table
- Fill the table with actual addresses

Moving back to our example, we can now visualize it as:

![alt text](image.png)

We know why we don't jump to libfoo from the program, otherwise it wouldn't be dynamic. But why not just from PLT to libfoo? Why go to GOT?

One reason is security. `Program` and `PLT` are executable but not writable. `GOT` is writeable but not executable. This way, we make it harder to hack since hackers can never abuse dynamic linking to run arbitrary code.

But we may be missing some details still, like what's this?

``` ARM
698: 913ea210 add x16, x16, #0xfa8
```

We already offset `x16` by `0xfa8`, so why do it again? Another question is why `1ffa0 50060000 00000000 50060000 00000000` is initially `650`?

## Lazy Binding

- We are doing symbol resolution, just laziy. This happens when a function is first called using the **PLT resolver**.
- The loader puts the resolver addr at `GOT+16`
```
1ff80 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 ................
1ff90 00000000 00000000 50060000 00000000 ........P.......
1ffa0 50060000 00000000 50060000 00000000 P.......P.......
```
- Resolver uses relocation data in ELF file:
  - `000000000001ffa8 R_AARCH64_JUMP_SLOT malloc@GLIBC_2.17`
- Then it adds `GOT` load addresses to the remaining `GOT` entries.

The first time we call `PLT`, the address in `GOT` points to another address that points to `PLT Resolver`. `PLT Resolver` then finds the proper address of `malloc` and puts that into the original address in `GOT`, overriding the one that points to `PLT Resolver`. That's what `x16` was for, to compute the offset from `PLT Resolver` to the original adress. We override it with `malloc`, and thus subsequent calls will link directly to `malloc`.

## Interposition

We can create wrappers around things like malloc and tell the dynamic linker to use ours instead.

That means we can use our malloc to intercept calls to any function/libraries. Very useful for debugging and checking.
