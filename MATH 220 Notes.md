# Math 220 Midterm 1 Notes

## Sets

- We denote the empty set with ∅.
- This is not the same as {∅}, which is a set with 1 element.
- This, then, {∅,{∅}}, is a set with 2 elements.

The cardinality of a set is defined as the number of elements in the set, and is denoted by:

$$
\begin{align*}
    S &= \{1,2,3\}\\
    |S| &= 3
\end{align*}
$$

## Implications

The **Conditional** is the statement "if $P$ then $Q$". This statement is true whenever $Q$ is true and $P$ is false.

**Modus Ponens** is defined as "If we know the implication $P \Rightarrow Q$, then if we know $P$ is true, $Q$ must be true.

Given the implication $P \Rightarrow Q$, we can form:

The **Converse:**
- $Q \Rightarrow P$
- This statement is the reverse of the original.

The **Contrapositive:**
- $\neg Q \Rightarrow \neg P$
- This statement has the same truth table as the original.
- The Negation of the Contrapositive is $P \Rightarrow \neg Q$

The **Biconditional:**
- $P \Longleftrightarrow Q$
- This means $P$ is true if and only if $Q$. This is only true when both share the same truth value.

## Useful Definitions

gcd($a,b$) and lcm($a,b$) are both useful properties that we can use in our proofs.

Euclidean Division states that any integer can be made with:

$$
\begin{align*}
    a = bq+r 
\end{align*}
$$

For some $q$ and $r$.
