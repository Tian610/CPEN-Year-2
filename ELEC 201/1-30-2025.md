**Open Circuit Test**

Open Circuit to find voltage with zero current

**Short Circuit Test**

Short Circuit to find current with zero voltage drop

## Linares' Method

Instead of creating an open or short circuit across an element, consider insteading place a resistor $R_x$ of unknown resistance there. Then,

$$ V_x = f(R_x)$$
$$ I_x = f(R_x)$$

Now, take the limit of $R_x$ to infinity to find:

$$\lim_{R_x \rightarrow\infty} V_x = V_{oc}$$

Similarly, take the limit to 0 to find:

$$\lim_{R_x \rightarrow0} I_x = I_{sc}$$

Thus, you can use one method to find both $V_{oc}$ and $I_{sc}$.
