# ELEC 201: Small Detour

We define Voltage and Current Sources. However, we make a significant distinction on **active** sources.

Circle shaped elements are active and generate voltage/current on their own. **Dependant** sources (denoted through a rhombus), naturally, depend on other sources to function. We use a +- symbol to denote Voltage and an arrow to show current.

- VCVS: Voltage Controlled Voltage Source
  - $V_{out} = aV_{in}$
- CCCS: Current Controlled Current Source
  - $I_{out} = aI_{in}$
- CCVS: Current Controlled Voltage Source
  - $V_{out} = aI_{in}$
- VCCS: Voltage Controlled Current Source
  - $I_{out} = aV_{in}$
- MOSFET: Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor
  - $I_{out} = K(V_{GS}-V_t)^2$

S = Source

**R Branch:**

$$ I_{od} = \frac{V_o-V_d}{R} $$

**RV Branch:**

$$I_{od} = \frac{V_o-V_d \plusmn V_s}{R}$$

**RI/I Branch**

$$I_{od}=I_s$$

**Evil (V) Branch:**

$$ V_{od} = V_{o} +V_{s} $$
