## Kirchoff Returns...

### Kirchoff's Voltage Law (KVL)
In any Loop, the sum of all the drops is zero:
$$  \sum_{loop} v_{drop} = 0 $$

### Kirchoff's Current Law (KCL)
The net current that enters a junction should be equivalent to the current that leaves it
$$ \sum_{GS} i_{in} = \sum_{GS} i_{out} $$

## Four Ideal Circuit Elements

### Resistance
Resists Current
$$ V= IR$$
### Inductance
Resistance to a change in current
$$ V = L \frac{di}{dt}$$
### Capacitance
$$ i = C \frac{dV}{dt} $$
