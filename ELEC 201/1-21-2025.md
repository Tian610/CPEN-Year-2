# ELEC 201: Modified Nodal Analysis

To solve a circuit, we always use a combination of:
- Ohms' Law
- KCL
- KVL

Many methods were invented throughout the years, but they all use a combination of the three methods above. just in different ways. The modern version of this we use is **Modified Nodal Analysis.**

## Some Terms:

**Controlling Variables (CTL)**
- Just a variable. For example, in a CCVS with a value of $3i_x$, the controlling variable is $i_x$
- In other words, the unknowns in our circuits

**Evil Currents (EVL)**
- The currents in Evil Branches are unknown, hence: Evil Currents!

**Node Voltages**

## The Solution Method:

1. Choose a reference node (True Nodes are better)
2. Choose R and RV current directions
   - When there are not controlling currents or voltages involved...
3. Label every true node (KCL)
   - No need to do the reference, since its just a combination of all the other true nodes
4. Identify, draw and label every "evil" current (EVL)
5. Locate and count every "controlling variable" (CTL)
