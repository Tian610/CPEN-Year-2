# Format Explanation - Tian

Below is an explanation of the format used to store course data.

### Notable items:
- Credits are stored as arrays since some courses offer varying credit levels
- Courses that appear in both prerequisites and postrequisites are corequisites courses
- cdf stands for "Credit/D/Fail" grading. Is simply a boolean for true or false
- schedule represents the [3-0-1*] thing (idk what else to call it).
- The others object simply contains all information not from the UBC Calendar website. So items like averages, medians, professors, course links, etc. will appear here
  - This list could be subject to change as we develop, hence why I thought to make it its own object

``` JSON
