# **Mission Statement:**

Helping students map their future.

# **Problem Description:**

Recently, a problem faced by UBC students was caused by the transition from the Student Service Centre (SSC) to Workday. A key feature that was lost during this transition was the Degree Navigator tool. This tool provided a structured way for students to track their degree progress and understand how courses fit into their graduation requirements. Currently, Workday has an academic progress tool, however it is missing important information like the ability to view pre-requisite courses easily and the ability to plan courses multiple years in advance.

Many students like to plan their courses several years in advance and without a proper tool, long-term academic planning becomes difficult and error prone.
