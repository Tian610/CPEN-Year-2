**Problem**:  
Recently, a problem faced by UBC students was caused by the transition from the Student Service Centre (SSC) to Workday. A key feature that was lost during this transition was the Degree Navigator tool. This tool provided a structured way for students to track their degree progress and understand how courses fit into their graduation requirements. Currently, Workday has an academic progress tool, however it is missing important information like the ability to view pre-requisite courses easily and the ability to plan courses multiple years in advance.

Many students like to plan their courses several years in advance and without a proper tool, long-term academic planning becomes difficult and error prone.

**Solution:**  
We have envisioned a website that graphically displays a tree of the pre-requisites of a course, and all courses that require it. This allows users to easily see the prerequisite they need to take in order to take a course, and helps them map a path through their University degree. Users can view course details such as

* Course name and description  
* Pre-requisite details  
* Dependent courses   
* Historical course averages  
* Lecture/tutorial/lab hours per week

The user would start by selecting a course they are interested in, and would then be presented with an interactive graph showing the course they selected at the center, and all of its prerequisites and dependents. It would also show more detailed information about the selected course, such as the prerequisite string from the UBC calendar, and how many hours and credits it is.   
The user would then be able to select a prerequisite or a dependent, which will make that course the selected course. However, the previously selected course and its prerequisites (or dependents) will still be shown. So, it will show the user a complete graph of every course theyâ€™ve looked at.  
A user will also be able to select their degree and specialization to filter out courses unrelated to them.
