### Introduction
Reliable Software is built on the concept of simplicity. However, any complex software, well, necessarily requires *complex* code. This could be considered the core difficulty of creating good softwareâ€”finding the balance between large feature sets and reliability.

Our goal in this course is to move from simple to complex programs. From sequential programs to parallel ones, functions with basic parameters to asynchronous and dynamic designs.

> *Flexibility is perhaps the key skill, besides good design.*

### Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
OOP is based around the concept of creating *objects*, each containing its own variables and functions, effectively creating a brand new data type. A `String`, for example, is a an object type.

### A Typical Design Process

1. Design software
2. Write Code
3. Test Code
4. Debug
5. Fix Errors
6. Rinse and Repeat
